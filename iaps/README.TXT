The International Affective Picture System, 1999NIMH Center for the Study of Emotion and AttentionUniversity of Florida   Gainesville, FL The pictures currently in the International Affective Picture System(IAPS) are included on this CD in a folder/directory called "Images".  Each of these pictures is in JPEG format, labelled by its IAPS catalog number and the .JPG extension (e.g. 1090.JPG). While the dimensions of any specific picture might vary slightly, the maximum size is 1024 x 768 pixels.  The pictures have been digitally color-corrected and in some cases reformatted for monitor viewing from the photographic slide version of the IAPS that we also distribute.	Affective norms (ratings of pleasure, arousal, and dominance; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1999) for the pictures currently in the IAPS were obtained in 12 separate studies involving approximately 60 pictures each.  The folder/directory called "Data" includes the files containing the normativepleasure, arousal and dominance ratings (means and standard deviations)for the pictures 1) averaged across all subjects, 2) averaged acrossmale subjects and 3) averaged across female subjects.  The extensions(.ibm, .mac) indicate whether the file is for Macintosh or IBM compatiblecomputers; all files are in tab-delimited ASCII (plain text) format, and can be readby most text editors, graphics packages and statistics packages.In order to view the image (.JPG) files, you will need software that is able to open and display JPEG files.  To view the data files (.ibm,.mac), you will need software that can open and read text files.Utilities  for viewing imagesYou may use any software you have that supports JPEG viewing.  If you have none, here are a few shareware suggestions that can be downloaded from the internet.WindowsYou can use Lview to view the IAPS images which are in JPEG format.  You can find it on Shareware.com (a Internet search engine accessible through netscape, net search or directly at http://www.shareware.com) on the internet. MacintoshYou can use the program Graphics Converter to view the IAPS images which are in JPEG format.  Graphics Converter is useful because it can display the pictures, it can do "slide shows", and it also allows for translation of images into other formats.  Correspondence concerning the IAPS can be directed to: Peter J.
